# LearnedIt
_Your own personal digital notebook of knowledge. Learn It, Store It, Retain It_

## UX

I am using a User-Centred Design Process to ensure my application is useful, usable, and provides value to both targeted users and myself (as the product owner).

I am using Jesse’s design approach to go through five different planes: Strategy, Scope, Structure, Skeleton, and Surface.

## Strategy

**Goals:**

A dashboard application for learners participating in the Software Developer Learning Journey. The LearnedIt application incorporates fun, useful features that will help enrich their learning experience enabling users to create unique, authentic learner journeys; so learners find their experience engaging, interactive, and most importantly memorable.

Perfect for those who want to take charge of their own learning and able to share their own accomplishments, struggles, and even moments of confusion.

**External User Goal:**
Manage learning experience, learn, store, and reflect upon software developer learning.

**Site Owner’s Goal:**
Enable users with tools to help enrich learning experience.

**Purpose:**

The purpose of the LearnedIt application is to encourage users to become more invested in their:
- Learning opportunities,
- Conduct a skills gap analysis,
- The goals they work towards, and
- The activities they pursue in getting there.

In essence, it helps learners to step back from their learning experience by helping to develop critical thinking skills and improve on future performance by reflecting and analyzing on what learners have learned and how far they have developed.
